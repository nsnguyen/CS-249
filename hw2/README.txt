The zip files contains HW2.pdf which is part A-E, and HW2_F.py for Part F.


========================================================================================================================

This programming assignment is written in Spyder IDE (https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/). The user can download Anaconda 3.6 package (https://www.continuum.io/downloads) which will include Spyder IDE. The programming F assignment is designed to run in Spyder in order to generate the 3D graphs correctly. 

Please do not run the script in terminal as the graphs will not be generated.

After install Anaconda, please boot up Spyder by typing ‘Spyder’ (without ‘)xs in terminal. All relevant packages are installed. Open HW2_F.py file.


In Spyder, you can highlight certain lines of code to run itself. Below is how to run the script properly to generate all the graphs. Please do not run the whole script at once because the graphs will not generate all the graphs (This is currently a bug in the package I believe).

-Highlight all import packages and run current cell (ctrl + Enter)
-Highlight Import Raw data section and run current cell (ctrl + Enter)
-Highlight RandomForestClassifier section to generate the importance of features ordered by descending.
-Highlight K-Means section to run K-Means algorithm for 1,3,5,11 clusters and generate the 3-D graph with their respective clustering, and running time.
-Highlight Birch section to run Birch algorithm for 1,3,5,11 clusters and generate the 3-D graph with their respective clustering, and running time.
-Highlight AgglomerativeClustering section to run AgglomerativeClustering algorithm for 1,3,5,11 clusters and generate the 3-D graph with their respective clustering, and running time.
-Highlight DBSCAN section to run DBSCAN algorithm for 1,3,5,11 clusters and generate the 3-D graph with their respective clustering, and running time.
