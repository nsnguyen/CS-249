This programming assignment is written in Spyder IDE (https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/). 
The user can download Anaconda 3.6 package which uses python version 3.6 (https://www.continuum.io/downloads) which will include Spyder IDE.

The python libraries needed in this program are mpl_toolkits, sklearn, pandas, numpy, and timeit. 
Anaconda includes all these packages so it's best to install Anaconda as mentioned above.

The programming F assignment is designed to run in Spyder in order to generate the 3D graphs correctly. 





After Anaconda is installed, there are two options to run the python script. 
The first one is through Spyder, by typing ‘Spyder’ (without ‘) in terminal. This is the preferred way.
The second way is to type 'python HW2_F.py' (without the single quote) in terminal. This will run the random forest first then generate each graph at a time. 
The graph must be closed for the next graph to show. Thus, the first method in Spyder is more preferred for this type of analysis.
